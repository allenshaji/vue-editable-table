> Editable data table in Vue.js
Now I can make the user to select the fields of the table, so that only those data from these fields will be displayed in the table. For eg: If a user select only fields userID,employeeCode, Then only data from userID,employeeCode will be displayed in the table.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
